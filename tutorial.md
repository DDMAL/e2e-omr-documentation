# End-to-End OMR Tutorial

This tutorial walks through downloading the images of a manuscript from a [IIIF](https://iiif.io) manifest, and then processing them with Rodan to produce a set of [MEI](https://music-encoding.org) documents reflecting the musical contents therein.
Depending on the available resources, it might be possible to skip some of the steps that are discussed in this tutorial.

If you're already familiar with Rodan and have an idea of how optical music
recognition works, then feel free to start this tutorial.
Otherwise you might want to read the [overview of Rodan]({{site.baseurl}}/overview/rodan) and [the other overview pages]({{site.baseurl}}/overview).
