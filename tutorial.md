# End-to-End OMR Tutorial

This tutorial walks through downloading the images for a manuscript from a [IIIF](https://iiif.io) manifest, processing them with Rodan to produce a set of [MEI](https://music-encoding.org) documents reflecting the musical contents therein.
Depending on the resources that are already available, it might be possible to skip some of these steps.

If you're already familiar with Rodan and have an idea of how optical music
recognition works, then feel free to start.
Otherwise you might want to read the [overview of Rodan](/overview/rodan) and [the other overview pages](/overview).
