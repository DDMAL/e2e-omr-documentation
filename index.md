This site is to provide information on the *Optical Music Recognition* (OMR) process and how to use it in the [Rodan workflow manager](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/Rodan).
This page will contain links to broad overviews of performing OMR and more specific guides on using each job within OMR, once those pages exist.
