# Getting Started

## Websites

Relatively up-to-date versions of Rodan can be found on the [staging site](https://rodan.staging.simssa.ca)
and [the new production site](https://rodan2.simssa.ca). A guest account with the username and password
"guest" is present on the staging site for new users trying out the system. As materials associated with this account may be deleted at any time,
anyone interested in using Rodan for OMR projects should contact <mailto:ddmal.lab.manager@gmail.com>.

For chant manuscripts and related information, the [Cantus database](http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/) is a must
to consult. The [Cantus Ultimus project](https://cantus.simssa.ca/) contains a subset of manuscripts from
Cantus that include OMR results and a browsing interface.

## Materials

A list of materials necessary for the OMR process, including where to get or how to generate the materials,
is present [on the index page]({{site.baseurl}}/index).
